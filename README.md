📘 Project Overview
The Bank Loan Report analyzes loan performance metrics such as funded amounts, repayments, and borrower behavior.
The project combines SQL queries for backend analysis and Power BI dashboards for data visualization.
This approach ensures analytical consistency through cross-validation — verifying Power BI results against SQL outputs.

🎯 Objectives
🧩 Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for bank loan monitoring
🧮 Perform SQL-based analysis to cross-check Power BI results
📊 Track metrics including:
              Total & Monthly Loan Applications (MTD / MoM)
              Total Funded & Received Amounts
              Average Interest Rate
              Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
              Good vs Bad Loan Ratios
              
📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard (shown in Capstone.pdf) includes:
Overview Page: Total applications, funded amounts, interest rate, DTI ratio
Summary Page: Good vs Bad loan breakdown, funding & repayment metrics
Details Page: Loan-level data with borrower insights (purpose, grade, home ownership, etc.)
